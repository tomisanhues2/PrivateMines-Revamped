# PrivateMines-Revamped

PrivateMines-Revamped starting code

Boilerplate was done under 6 hours. Fully tested 1.19.3. No bugs, Private Client Request.

This will be converted into a premium plugin very soon. Allowing insane customizability and stability just like UltraStorage.

This plugin was requested by @KingKai for his server given all alternatives are way below standards. Currently the plugin is being used and works without a single issue.

**PrivateMines-Revamped was not thought of as a public plugin or a longterm solution. Yet it is completely functional and efficient.**

**No support will be provided.**
